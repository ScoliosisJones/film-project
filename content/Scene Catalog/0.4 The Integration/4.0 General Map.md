ID corners the EGO/SUPEREGO (MAN) in the flood channel. We can do a reveal or whatever. ID moves like an animal, makes gross noises etc. The MAN takes aim at ID and shoots him. Black impact frame. ID is galloping on fours towards the MAN. The MAN loads another bullet and racks it, takes aim and shoots again. Blood sprays out. ID continues towards his prey. Fumbling with the bullet the MAN drops it to the ground. ID tackles him, bringing him to the ground, mauling at his chest and ripping him apart. The MAN grabs a rock from the floor and bashes ID in the head while kicking him off. He grabs the bullet from the ground, loads it, racks it, takes aim. He fires.

I had an idea to change our color space visually between each bullet firing. B&W to Red, to an aged B&W look.

ID is dead, our MAN takes his keys and exits the flood channel into the detention basin, -OR- from the flood channel, back to the dunes, then remerging in the desert hills off the detention basin. He makes his way to the car and drives off on the same road he was crashed into on in the intro. Basically reproduce the intro scene, following the car along the road until we illuminate a man coming over the hill. The car passes through the man instead of hitting him, and the film ends.

But whether the integration was successful or not is unknown. It can go either way but I see it as an imperfect work. Improperly following through with the Great Work and I see him ending in the Palace in the throne but without his crown. See [Plato's cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave) or [Theory of Forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms). I'm down for whatever ending we see fit.

We can have Dash's "Watchers" over looking here. or the flood channel can be lined with lifeless husks staring towards the wall on either side.

We should, at some point after the end, see the MAN now integrated and resolved his full psychic apparatus, sat in the chair. King of his palace. He's made it out of the cave and seen the sunlight. He's ascended from the marketplace and reached the palace.
