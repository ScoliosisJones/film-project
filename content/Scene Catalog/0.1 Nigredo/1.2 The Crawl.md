FADE IN: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

The MAN is lying on the road some feet from where the car came to stop, drowned in the warm yellow glow of the headlights.

Regaining consciousness, the MAN peels himself off the road. He looks to the car for his ASSAILANT. What the MAN sees in the drivers seat is not of this place. His eyes widen and glass over as his breath becomes rapid and shallow.
The MAN frantically pulls himself to all fours and then to his feet as he flees the car. As the MAN stands on his left leg its fully collapses under him. He lets out a whimper and falls to the ground. Again the MAN pulls himself to his feet, this time with his right leg, and breaks for the desert hills lining the road.

The MAN drags himself up the raised desert hill overlooking the road. The car and the road disappear as the MAN limps further into the desert. We hear a car door SLAM from behind. The ASSAILANT is now in pursuit.

The MAN spots the detention basin and various structures and trash within it and heads towards. To hide or to distance himself

A JACKETED MAN stands atop a stair-like rock formation, his back to the detention basin, faintly front lit. The MAN calls out in desperation

<p style="text-align:center;">MAN (shouting)<br>Hey! Please you've got help me, please!</p>

The sound of dirt and rock cascading down behind the MAN pulls his attention away. For a moment the MAN whips around to see behind him, and when he turns back the JACKETED MAN is gone.
<p style="text-align:center;">MAN (shouting)<br>Wait!</p>
The MAN loudly and scrappily clambers up the rock and dirt with urgency.
An impossible sight is waiting for him at the top of his ascent: A half constructed white room that is somehow self lit, almost glowing. The MAN has no other choice but to proceed towards the room

The walls separate as the MAN stares into the seam where the panels meet. An impossibly long and dark hallway is revealed. The MAN passes through the threshold.

Maybe when the MAN steps into the room, it's no longer open to the world and is fully enclosed, otherwise unsure how to make the hallway look believable.
Also if we like the visual, the hallway can be tooth lined and writhing. A living thing.
