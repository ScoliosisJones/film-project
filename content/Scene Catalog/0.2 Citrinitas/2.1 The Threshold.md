We can go two ways here, one of which as follows. The other being our hallway acting as an area similar to the sunken place in Get Out, or the voids in Stranger Things and Under the Skin

That is we have our character traverse through this place to move the story along. Or we skip the intermittent scene and cut from him entering the hallway to him emerging elsewhere. 
Or as follows:

INT. BLACK VOID

An endless expanse of black. Silent.
We linger in the void.
A faint electric HUM begins to rise.
A single POINT OF LIGHT emerges at an immeasurable distance.

CUT TO:

An old FLUORESCENT LIGHT heating up.
The HUM grows louder as the filament warms.
Warm yellow light expands out, filling the frame

GLASS SHATTERS
// could be just the sound and doesn't need to be seen idk.

The HUM fizzles out.

Darkness.

The sound of sand shifting around.

Shapes begin to emerge.
