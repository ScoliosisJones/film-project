ID corners the EGO/SUPEREGO in the flood channel. We can do a reveal or whatever. ID moves like an animal, makes gross noises etc. EGO/SUPEREGO takes aim at ID and shoots him. Black impact frame. ID is galloping on fours towards EGO/SUPEREGO. EGO/SUPEREGO loads another bullet and racks it, takes aim and shoots again. Blood sprays out. ID continues towards his prey. Fumbling with the bullet EGO/SUPEREGO drops it to the ground. ID tackles him, bringing him to the ground, mauling at his chest and ripping him apart. EGO/SUPEREGO grabs a rock from the floor and bashes ID in the head while kicking him off. He grabs the bullet from the ground, loads it, racks it, takes aim. He fires.

ID is dead, our MAN takes his keys and exits the flood channel into the detention basin, -OR- from the flood channel, back to the dunes, then remerging in the desert hills off the detention basin. He makes his way to the car and drives off on the same road he was crashed into on in the intro. Basically reproduce the intro scene, following the car along the road until we illuminate a man coming over the hill. The car passes through the man instead of hitting him, and the film ends.

We can have Dash's "Watchers" over looking here. or the flood channel can be lined with lifeless husks staring towards the wall on either side.

We should, at some point after the end, see the MAN now integrated and resolved his full psychic apparatus, sat in the chair. King of his palace. He's made it out of the cave and seen the sunlight. He's ascended from the marketplace and reached the palace.
