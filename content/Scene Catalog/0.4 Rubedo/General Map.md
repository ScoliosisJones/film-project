ID corners the EGO/SUPEREGO in the flood channel. We can do a reveal or whatever. ID moves like an animal, makes gross noises etc. EGO/SUPEREGO takes aim at ID and shoots him. ID is galloping on fours towards EGO/SUPEREGO and two more shots fire off. ID is dead, our MAN takes his keys and exits the flood channel into the detention basin, -OR- from the flood channel, back to the dunes, then remerging in the desert hills off the detention basin. He makes his way to the car and drives off on the same road he was crashed into on in the intro.

We can have Dash's "Watchers" over looking here. or the flood channel can be lined with lifeless husks staring towards the wall on either side.
