## Maps

Each section mapped out very generally. Language and writing is rough and unpolished.

- [[1.0 General Map]] - Yet to map out, as the first scenes are mostly laid out already.
- [[2.0 General Map]]
- [[3.0 General Map]]
- [[4.0 General Map]] - Very early stages of ideation.

NOTE: These events do not take place in any sort of realistic physical space. These areas are thought out as taking place within the mind.
