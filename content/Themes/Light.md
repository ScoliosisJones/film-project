Photons carry the electromagnetic force, in other words, light intermediates all physical interactions we make in this world beyond gravity and the forces holding our particles together.

We truly are beings of light.

We travel in light.

There truly is no place devoid of light, if there is we couldn't exist there.

Additionally

Light defines darkness - Darkness is the absence of light.

It makes sense to me that light will mediate the travel between places.
