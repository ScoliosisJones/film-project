The Magnum Opus is the transmutation of the prima material into the philosopher's stone. The prima materia is unadulterated chaos, and the philosopher's stone is the purification of such.

The Magnum Opus is made up of four stages:

[Nigredo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigredo) - Decomposition, blackening, the first step in the process towards purification.
[Albedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo_(alchemy)) - Washing away of impurities, bringing light to the prima materia
[Citrinitas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrinitas) - Yellowing, the solar light.
[Rubedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubedo) - Redness, the alchemical success. The end of the great work (Magnum Opus)
