Freud's three system model of the human psyche

Id, Ego and Superego

The [Id](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_superego#Id) is our collection of animalistic primal needs and urges. Violence and Lust. Note the ["Death Drive"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_drive).


The [Superego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_superego#Superego) has internalized ideas on social constraints, instilled in us by our society and our caregivers.

The [Ego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_superego#Ego) acts upon a resolution formed between the Id and Superego, mediating thoughts and actions between the two very different systems. Follows the ["Reality Principle"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_principle).

The Superego and the ego are born first from the Id.
